# 1 class and instance

> class is a set of things having some property or attribute in common: like animal,it's a set none.ã€‹ i

in computer, every is a object. 2 is an instance, which belong to *int* class, 12.34 is an instance, which belong to "double" class.

how to define a user-defined type (or class) in c++ ?  recall that a class is a set of things having some attribute in common. in practice, what we usually do is: observe many objects and its attributes, and abstract a set of things having common attribute into a class. after that, we can generate many objects by that class.


a class specification in c++ has two part:

* a class declaration, which describes the atributes that class have. particarlly, member variables and member functions, termed methods

* the class method definition. which describe how certain class member functions are implemented.


> generally, a class has many attributes. according to it's access control, they can be catogary into three: public, private, protect.


# 2 class declaration

~~~
// stock00.h -- stock class
// version 0.1

#ifndef STOCK00_H_
#define STOCK00_H_

#include <string>

class Stock              // class declaration
{
private:
    std::string company_name;
    long shares;
    double share_val;
    double total_val;
    void set_tot(){ total_val = shares * shares_val;}

public:
    void acquire(const std::string & co, long n, double pr);
    void buy(long num, double price);
    void update(double price);
    void show();
};                        // note semicolon at the end

#endif

# 3 class definition -- implementing class member functions

member function definition in a class are much lile regular function definition, but they also have two special characteristics:

* when you define a member function, you use the scope-resolution operator(::) to identify the class to  which the function belong.
* class methods can access the private attributes of the class.
