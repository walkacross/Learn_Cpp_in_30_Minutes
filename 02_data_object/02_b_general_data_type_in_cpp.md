# data type in c++

# 1 overview of data types in cpp
belows are the overview of data types in cpp and the data type of a data object will determine some other attributes of it, like size.

1build-in data type
    1.1 fundamental types
        1.1.1 inteeger type
            char
            short;
            int;
            long;
            long long;
        1.1.2 floating-point type
            float;
            double;
            long double;
        1.1.3 char type
        1.1.4 bool type
    1.2 compound types
        1.2.1 strings
        1.2.2 array
        1.2.3 pointers
        1.2.4 reference
        1.2.5 structure
2third-party data type

# 2objects with different data type have different attributes
data object with different data type will have different size, which will thereby determin the available range of data_object.value.
~~~
int is 4 bytes.
short is 2 bytes.
long is 8 bytes.
long long is 8 bytes.

Maximum vales:
int: 2147483647
short: 32767
long: 9223372036854775807
long long: 9223372036854775807

Minimum int value = -2147483648
bits per byte = 8
