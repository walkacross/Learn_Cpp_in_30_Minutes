When working with a programming language, we can use several methods to optimize the code and enhance a program’s performance. For example, in the C language, the Macro function is used to reduce the program’s execution time. Since C++ is an extension of C, it also provides a function called the inline function, which can speed up a program by reducing the execution time. 

In this article, we will discuss all the important concepts that are required to have an in-depth understanding of the inline function in C++.  This article covers all aspects of the inline functions that can be used to enhance a program’s performance and efficiency.
